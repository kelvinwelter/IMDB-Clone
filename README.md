### :sound: This project was built based on the classes of the AcceleraDev React course made available by [CodeNation](https://codenation.dev/)

## :straight_ruler: Techs used in the project

**Website**: The website frontend was built just using HTML and CSS (FlexBox is amazing)

**Deploy**: I used Netlify to deploy the website due to the ease of using it (just selected this repository and it was published in 5 seconds) and the free plan they also offer.
